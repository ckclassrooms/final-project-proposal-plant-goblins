# Final Project Proposal - Plant tracker
Group - Kenan Arica

## What does it do?
- My application stores and tracks maintainence on their gardens and plants.
I find it very difficult myself to keep track of when I watered what plants, as most plants have specific watering routines required, so watering them all at the same time may not work best.
My app will allow a user to log in, create any number of plants that (hopefully) correspond to plants in real life, and mark when they water them. 
Time permitting, I hope to add some form of layout system that allows users to view their plants (and watered status) in some form of meaningful geolocative way. 
For example, a user has houseplants and an outdoor garden. The user assigns plants X and Y to the `garden` group, and can easily pull up their garden plants 
with the click of a button. After that, analytics can be provided about plant insights.

## How is it different from a CRUD app? 
My app will be able to provide analytics and easy visual access to chronological information that is vital for maintaing a healthy garden. CRUD operations are, admittedly, a large part of the project.
However, I am hoping that the aspect of organization and intuitive metric visualization will set it apart. 

## Security / Privacy concerns
When holding user data, albeit nontraditional types of data about their plants, it is extremely important to pay close attention to detail in security.
Holding this data alone is a privacy concern, and will be addressed by using a popular authentication service to ensure that exploiting a vulnerability in my service will be just as difficult as exploiting a vulnerability in most of the other internet services.
